      We are going to be pricing our product at $89.99. After interviewing potential customers and looking at the competitors in the market, this price has become apparent that it is the sweetspot. It is high enough where we will make a very good profit margin while the customers expect something that has a lot of features and is built with quality in mind, while also being low enough where the purchase doesn't break the bank, and an individual could easily go from visiting our website for the first time to finalizing their purchase of BotBuddy in one sitting.<br>

      In the beginning, online will make up 100% of our initial sales. Using our calculations we have done in the past, we conservatively estimate that in the first year, we would sell 3800 units. The total COGS for the first year is $135,660; the total revenue for the first year is $341,962. Our first year profit would be $206,302.<br>

      As time goes on, we would be able to negotiate lower prices with our suppliers, as well as gain more yearly sales as our product becomes more known with more amazing reviews and testimonials. We estimate in the second year, we could sell about 15,000 units, and in the third year 60,000 units. There would be costs for marketing, online store hosting, further development, and more, but overall we would be able to launch and sell this product effectively.<br>
