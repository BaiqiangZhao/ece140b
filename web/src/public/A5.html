      1. What basic information does a typical user need to have access to on first interaction with your product?
    </p>
    <p>
      For our TheraBot, a typical user needs to know to how turn it on, how to charge it, how to configuare the setting of the bot, where to find user's guide. 
    </p>
    <p>
      2. What IA Design Principles (Dan Brown) are important for your product?
    </p>
    <p>
       IA Design Principles are important for Therabot, including Principles of Choices(the user interface should be simple and easy to interact so it would not confuse users) and Principle of Examples(all buttons on the interface should be predictable and intuitive)
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Which structural Organizational Principle(s) make(s) the most the sense for your product?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hierarchical Principle would make the most sense for our product. Our product and its interface should not increase our users' cognitive load. We can put more effort on color, contrast, size and movement to make our product easier to use.

    <p>
      Three Principles of Visual Hierarchy to guide users to the interactions that you have added to your website
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Size and Scale: I made the images size fit to the brower windows so every user could see the entire image.
      2. Color and Contrast: the "Go to Home" button on the end of a page is colored and very easy to see, so users can easily find it.
      3. Alignment: The all buttons and text on my website are organized and neat.
