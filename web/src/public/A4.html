      1. Fitts's Law:<br>
      A example for Fitts's Law could be Google Search page. It puts the insert box, buttons and images all on the center of the page, which makes users easier and faster to interact with it. <br><br>
      2. Jacob's Law: <br>
      A example for Jacob's Law could be electrical cars. Even though electrical cars have different source of power, they all have brake and gas paddles the same way as traditional cars do. <br><br>
      3. Law of Pragnaz:<br>
      iPhone has many icons for its applications which uses the Law of Pragnaz. For example, it puts cloud and sun on Weather app, music notes on Music app, and a cardholder on Wallet app and so on. Users can easilly understand the function of each app by simple look at the icon of that app.
